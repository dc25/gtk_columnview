# gtk_columnview

## what?

Rust program showing how to use gkt4/ColumnView type to display mutiple columns in a gtk window.

## why?

I couldn't find a good example showing how to do this so I wrote one.

## anything else?

* Written in Rust.  
* Tested on Linux and Windows 10
* Shows 2 columns
* Shows 100000 rows
* ListModelExt implemented by StringList containing StringObject(s) - both included in GTK4



Please let me know if I got anything wrong or left anything out.
